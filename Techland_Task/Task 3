# A couple of words before
1. Would be nice to define term most "powerful". This could be:
    - smallest TTD (we can reuse query from Task 2)
    - highest DPS
    - highest total damage
    - most common one (if META exists, people would tend to use the best item/trinket/etc). Cause there might be some 'hidden' buffs
2. I would stick with the definition that most powerful - is the most used (you dont want to nerf some REALY COOL unobvious things until they become common)


#  Query
SELECT 
    item_id, 
    MAX(LEFT(attached_entities, LOCATE(';', attached_entities) - 1)) AS perk, 
    COUNT(LEFT(attached_entities, LOCATE(';', attached_entities) - 1)) AS perk_count
FROM 
    test_item_appearance
GROUP BY 
    item_id;


# Output
+-----------+--------------+------------+
| item_id   | perk         | perk_count |
+-----------+--------------+------------+
| @knife_01 | -            |          2 |
| @bow_13   | sharpshooter |          1 |
+-----------+--------------+------------+


# Commments
/*  
this query shows us most used perks for each weapon


if we wanted to use TTD as a metric, we could use table from previous Task as CTE (or create a materialized view, whatever)
Join the table containning TTD with test_item_appearance (on item_id), group by item, perk and get average TTD
